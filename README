Time::Interval
==============

This package installs the Time::Interval perl module.
Time::Interval's primary purpose is to take a given number
of seconds and return the number of days, hours, minutes,
and seconds are represented. This is handier than you 
think, and of course, I'm fairly certain that I'm not the
the first/best/only one to have done this with perl.
However, this is my attempt, and I think at the very least
the name makes the intent of the module clear.

NOTE: this module does NOT handle resolutions < 1 second.
For that have a look at Time::HiRes. This module will 
quantize fractional second values to whole numbers.

thank you and enjoy,
