Revision history for Perl extension Time::Interval.

1.233		Fri Nov 22 15:49:20 CST 2013
		fixed a long standing issue with parseInterval and fractional seconds.
		NOTE: Date::Parse, does NOT handle resolutions < 1 second. For that,
		you really should have a look at Time::HiRes. This fix quantizes fractional
		second values to whole numbers. 		
		Thanks for the patch, Bob <bob_freeman@hms.harvard.edu> !

		submitted by: Doug Ferguson <dougf@bookings.nl>.

		'more correct', this also allows older versions of perl to 
		use Time::Interval. Thanx, Doug!
